# Rainbow-RL-Agent
Ultimate version of Reinforcement Learning **Rainbow Agent** with Tensorflow 2 from paper "Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning".
My version can handle Recurrent Neural Nets and Multi Parallelized Environments.

The Rainbow Agent is a DQN agent with strong improvments :
- **DoubleQ-learning** : Adding a Target Network that is used in the loss function and upgrade once every `tau` steps. See paper [Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)
- **Distributional RL** : Approximating the probability distributions of the Q-values instead of the Q-values themself. See paper : [A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887)
- **Prioritizedreplay** : Sampling method that prioritize experiences with big *Temporal Difference(TD) errors* (~loss) at the beginning of a training. See paper : [Prioritized Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)
- **Dueling Networks**: Divide neural net stream into two branches, an action stream and a value stream. Both of them combined formed the Q-action values. See paper : [Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)
- **Multi-step learning** : Making Temporal Difference bigger than classic DQN (where TD = 1). See paper [Multi-step Reinforcement Learning: A Unifying Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01327)
- **NoisyNets** : Replace classic epsilon-greedy exploration/exploitation with noise in the Neural Net. [Noisy Networks for Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10295)
